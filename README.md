Based on the arcade game whack a mole.  Here you have 30 seconds to score the highest points you can by clicking on the witness the prosecutor, and the defense attorney.  But don't whack the judge or the game is over.

Click on:
Witness = 2 pts
Prosecutor = 1 pt
Defense Attorney = 1 pt
Judge = 0 pts and ends the game early
